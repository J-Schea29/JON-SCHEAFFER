             them from mathematics, meanwhile he himself omitting those formed by two separate motions. In contrast, I advocate for Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas’ view 
             that mathematics involves quantities abstracted from motion and matter. While Descartes and modern mathematicians were not misguided in employing motion 
             for comprehension of mathematics, a curved lines' definition relies on unchanging aspects of the function rather than what is variable.  </p>

          <p style="font-size: 1vw; margin-top: 1vw; margin-right: 7vw;"><b>Summary:</b> Amid climate shocks such as droughts and floods, smallholder farmers endure the most
            severe repercussions. Empowering these farmers with knowledge and skills in climate-resilient
            farming techniques becomes crucial in enabling them to overcome the challenges presented by
            climate-related adversity. In this paper, we study smallholder farmers in Maharashtra, India to
            assess the impact of Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) on sugar cane yield and cultivation
            costs. We employ an instrumental variable approach and find that implementing more GAPs
            decreases a farmer’s cultivation costs significantly and decreases their yields non-significantly.</p>
